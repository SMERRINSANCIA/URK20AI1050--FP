      "article: Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\n",

Rahul Kumar, 17, clambered over the enclosure fence at the Kamla Nehru Zoological Park in Ahmedabad, and began running towards the animals, shouting he would 'kill them'. Mr Kumar explained afterwards that he was drunk and 'thought I'd stand a good chance' against the predators. Next level drunk: Intoxicated Rahul Kumar, 17, climbed into the lions' enclosure at a zoo in Ahmedabad and began running towards the animals shouting 'Today I kill a lion!' Mr Kumar had been sitting near the enclosure when he suddenly made a dash for the lions, surprising zoo security. The intoxicated teenager ran towards the lions, shouting: 'Today I kill a lion or a lion kills me!' A zoo spokesman said: 'Guards had earlier spotted him close to the enclosure but had no idea he was planing to enter it. 'Fortunately, there are eight moats to cross before getting to where the lions usually are and he fell into the second one, allowing guards to catch up with him and take him out. 'We then handed him over to the police.'

      "article: Liverpool target Neto is also wanted by PSG and clubs in Spain as Brendan Rodgers faces stiff competition to land the Fiorentina goalkeeper, according to the Brazilian's agent Stefano Castagna. The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga. Neto joined Fiorentina from Atletico Paranaense in 2011 and established himself as No1 in the last two seasons.\n",

      "article: Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.\n",
